# Connect Action Enhancement - Direct Connection Feature

## Overview
Enhanced Connect action để thực hiện kết nối trực tiếp với resource đã lưu thay vì luôn hiển thị Connection Dialog.

## New Behavior

### Connect Action Logic:
```
Click Connect Action (unchecked → checked):
├── If last_resource exists:
│   ├── Log: "Attempting to connect to last resource: {resource}"
│   ├── Call _handle_connection_request(last_resource)
│   └── Result:
│       ├── Success → Action stays checked, UI updates
│       └── Failure → Action auto-unchecks, error dialog
└── If no last_resource:
    ├── Log: "No last resource found - showing connection dialog"  
    ├── Show Connection Dialog
    └── Result:
        ├── Dialog OK → Connection attempt, save new last_resource
        └── Dialog Cancel → Action auto-unchecks
```

### Disconnect Action Logic:
```
Click Connect Action (checked → unchecked):
├── Call _disconnect_device()
├── Update action: text → "Connect", unchecked state
└── Update UI: status, connection lamp, etc.
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Last Resource Storage
```python
# In __init__:
self.last_resource = None  # Store last connected resource

# In _load_settings():
self.last_resource = self.settings.value("last_resource", None, type=str)

# In _save_settings():
if self.last_resource:
    self.settings.setValue("last_resource", self.last_resource)
```

### 2. Connection Success Handling
```python
# In _handle_connection_request():
if success:
    # Save the successful resource
    self.last_resource = resource_name
    # ... rest of success handling
```

### 3. Connection Failure Handling
```python
# In _handle_connection_failure():
# Update Connect action state
self.connect_action.setChecked(False)
# ... rest of failure handling
```

### 4. Enhanced Toggle Logic
```python
def _toggle_connection(self):
    if self.connect_action.isChecked():
        if self.last_resource:
            # Direct connection attempt
            self._handle_connection_request(self.last_resource)
        else:
            # Show dialog for first-time connection
            self._show_connection_dialog()
    else:
        # Disconnect
        self._disconnect_device()
```

## User Experience Benefits

### Before Enhancement:
- Connect action → Always shows Connection Dialog
- User has to select resource every time
- Multiple clicks required for repeated connections

### After Enhancement:
- **First time**: Connect action → Show Connection Dialog (normal flow)
- **Subsequent times**: Connect action → Direct connection to last resource
- **Faster workflow**: Single click reconnection
- **Fallback**: Shows dialog if no last resource available

## Error Handling

### Connection Failures:
- ✅ Connect action automatically unchecks
- ✅ Error dialog displays failure reason
- ✅ UI state properly reset (connection lamp, status, etc.)

### Dialog Cancellation:
- ✅ Connect action automatically unchecks
- ✅ No connection attempt made
- ✅ UI state remains disconnected

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Connection
1. Click Connect → No last resource → Shows dialog
2. Select resource + OK → Connection attempt
3. Success: Resource saved as last_resource, action checked
4. Failure: Action unchecked, error shown

### Scenario 2: Reconnection
1. Click Connect → Has last resource → Direct connection attempt  
2. Success: Action stays checked, connected
3. Failure: Action unchecks, error shown, fallback to dialog on next click

### Scenario 3: Dialog Workflow
1. Click Connect → Shows dialog (no last resource or user preference)
2. Cancel dialog → Action unchecks automatically
3. Re-click Connect → Shows dialog again

## Configuration Persistence

### Settings Saved:
- `last_resource`: String containing last successful resource name
- Persists across application restarts
- Enables immediate reconnection after app restart

### Settings Location:
- Registry (Windows): HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\RIGOL\DP2031_Controller
- Key: `last_resource`
- Example value: `"TCPIP::192.168.1.100::INSTR"`

## Logging Integration

### Log Messages:
```
# Direct connection attempt:
"Attempting to connect to last resource: {resource}"

# No saved resource:  
"No last resource found - showing connection dialog"

# Connection success:
"Connection established successfully"

# Connection failure:
"Connection failed: {error_message}"
```

## Backwards Compatibility
- ✅ Existing Connection Dialog still accessible via Tools menu
- ✅ All existing connection workflows preserved
- ✅ Settings migration handled gracefully (defaults to None)
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing API

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED & TESTED**  
**Benefits**: Improved user workflow, faster reconnections, better UX
**Impact**: Reduces connection time from ~3 clicks to 1 click for repeat connections
